# Data Science
This repository is a collection of Informatics coursework and personal data science projects using BeautifulSoup, pandas, and scikit-learn. The two files "CSV Parsing" and "Beautiful Soup" were projects from my Python course--they are renamed from the original assignment titles for clarity. The file "Neural Nets Walkthrough" is an explanatory file I wrote to help anyone interested in how a basic neural network works--I included lots of commentary in the Neural Net file, as it can be confusing, but can upload in-depth explanations if requested!

# Warning
You are welcome to download, modify, and run these files as you please. However, some of these files have been submitted to a grading database--do not attempt to reupload these for course assignments-- modified or not, IT WILL BE FLAGGED AS PLAGIARIZED!
