# Data Science
This repository is a collection of Informatics coursework and personal data science projects using BeautifulSoup, pandas, and scikit-learn. The two files "CSV Parsing" and "Beautiful Soup" were projects from my Python course--they are renamed from the original assignment titles for clarity. The two CSVs are required to demo the "CSV Parsing" file. "Neural Nets Walkthrough" is an explanation to help anyone interested in the basics of how a neural network works--I also included lots of commentary in the Neural Net file, as the code can be intially confusing. Hope this helps!
# Warning
