# Data Science
This repository is a collection of Informatics coursework and personal data science projects using BeautifulSoup, pandas, and scikit-learn. The file "Neural Nets Walkthrough" is an explanatory file I wrote to help anyone interested in how a basic neural network works--I included lots of commentary in the Neural Net file, as it can be confusing, but can upload in-depth explanations if requested!
