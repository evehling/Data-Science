# Data Science
This repository is a collection of coursework and personal python projects involving data science. I've included a few files using BeautifulSoup, pandas, and scikit-learn. The file "Neural Nets Walkthrough" is an explanatory file I wrote to help anyone interested in how a basic neural network works.
